# APEG

APEG is a web application that allows students completing group work to evaluate each other's contribution to the group.

### Adaptable

APEG is template driven and built on open-source software [libraries](https://bitbucket.org/sijpkes/lti-peer-assessment), templates can easily be modified to provide custom content.

### Peer Evaluation

Peer evaluation is the assessment or review of work by one or more people of similar competence to the producers of the work ([peers](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/peer#Etymology_2)) ([Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review)).  

### for Groups

Groups of students are able to assess each others contribution to a team using APEG.

APEG can incorporate a Blackboard&trade; [rubric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)) or allow students to supply a numeric 'grade' with comments. The application is optimised for use with the [Blackboard Learn&trade; VLE](http://anz.blackboard.com/sites/international/globalmaster/).

The application can be adapted to to any VLE that implements the IMS Global<sup>&reg;</sup> Learning Tools Interoperability<sup>&reg;</sup> (LTI) standard.  

## Self and Peer Assessment Resource Kit (SPARK) ##

APEG uses the Self and Peer Assessment Resource Kit developed by Willey, Freeman and Gardner et. al. at UTS to provide a Self Performance Assessment (SPA) multiplier for instructors to apply to group work scores and a Self Assessment to Peer Assessment (SAPA) factor as a feedback score to students.

This gives students an indicator of how they perceive their own performance in relation to the group's perception of their performance.

A score greater than 1.0 indicates students over-rated their performance in comparison to the group.  

A score less than 1.0 indicates students under-rated their performance in comparison to the group.

For detailed information on the SPARK equations please see the [Spark<sup>PLUS</sup> documentation](http://sparkplus.com.au/factors/).
