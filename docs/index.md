# Peer Review Platform

## What is it?

The peer review platform (PRP) is a web application that allows students completing group work to evaluate each other's contribution to the group using a [rubric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)) or by giving a numeric 'grade'. The application is optimised for use with the [Blackboard Learn VLE](http://anz.blackboard.com/sites/international/globalmaster/).

The application can be adapted to to any VLE that implements the IMS Global<sup>&reg;</sup> Learning Tools Interoperability<sup>&reg;</sup> (LTI) standard.
