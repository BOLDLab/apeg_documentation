## Adding the LTI Link

Once the templates have been setup by the [Administrator](Administrators.md) you will be supplied with the details for the LTI link as it appears in [Blackboard Learn](https://uonline.newcastle.edu.au/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabAction?tab_tab_group_id=_301_1)

## LTI Link Settings

Once the link has been placed in your course, you can manage settings as an Instructor by clicking the link.  To preview the tool, it is first necessary to activate the [student preview](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Courses/Student_Preview) in Blackboard.  Once in student preview, click the LTI link you created above.

#### Adding a Description (Single Line Only)

Note that there is a bug in blackboard that does not properly encode multi-line descriptions, so keep your description short and on a single line.
